# MindBridge

MindBridge is an innovative communication aid designed for non-verbal autistic children, empowering them to express their needs and emotions. Our application utilizes intuitive design, advanced machine learning for text-to-speech capabilities, and real-time messaging to create a supportive environment for children, caregivers, and parents.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Large buttons and customizable, soothing color schemes tailored to the sensory preferences of autistic children.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implemented using Twilio's API, allowing for instant updates and messaging between children and their caregivers.
- **AI-Driven Speech**: A machine learning text-to-speech system that provides a natural and comforting voice for the children's expressed needs.
- **Data Security**: User data is securely stored with MongoDB, with plans to integrate Auth0 for robust authentication.
- **Accessible Anywhere**: Hosted with a custom GoDaddy domain to ensure global accessibility.
